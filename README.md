# NTR-Bridge-ESP-Devices

## üéÆ Stream your New Nintendo 3DS with low latency!

Do you love gaming on your New Nintendo 3DS and want to record your screen without lags or interruptions?  
And you have an ESP device lying around and don't know what to do with it?  
**Here is the perfect solution!**

This project improves NTR streaming by putting an ESP device into **AP mode** (Access Point mode).  
It **does not** provide an internet connection ‚Äî so your NTR signal won't get disturbed by other devices using bandwidth.  
It also comes with a web interface for easy configuration.

üìñ Check the [installation instructions](#installation-methods) below.

# üöÄ Installation Methods

## üõ†Ô∏è Preparation

1. Install [Python](https://python.org). Download the version for your OS:
   - [Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   - Linux (Debian-based, usually preinstalled):  
     ```bash
     sudo apt install python3 -y
     ```
   - [macOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)

2. Install `esptool`:
   - **Windows**:  
     Open a terminal as administrator and run:  
     ```bash
     pip install esptool --break-system-packages
     ```
   - **Linux**:  
     Open a terminal and run:  
     ```bash
     sudo pip install esptool --break-system-packages
     ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** `--break-system-packages` will not break your system.  
   It is required in Python 3.12+ because of stricter package management rules.

3. Choose your installation method:
   - ‚úÖ [GUI Method (easy)](#-installation-using-gui-method)
